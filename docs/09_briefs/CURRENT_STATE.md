# Where I am as of 2026-04-15 (Phase 1.5A in flight)

## Phase 1.5A — Organization Profile Expansion (in flight)

Execution brief drafted at `docs/09_briefs/phase-1.5/brief.md`.
This sub-phase (first of three — 1.5A additive org schema,
1.5B users/invites/MFA, 1.5C permissions refactor) precedes
Phase 1.2 agent integration because the agent design depends on
the expanded org profile, typed `external_ids`, and granular
`source_system` tracking on journal entries.

**1.5A scope:** additive organizations columns, new `industries`
lookup table (NAICS-light, 27 seed entries), new
`organization_addresses` table (one-to-many, typed by purpose),
two-step `industry_id` migration (add + backfill + NOT NULL now;
drop legacy enum column later), `journal_entries.source_system`
+ `source_external_id` for integration reconciliation,
`orgService.updateOrgProfile` + `addressService` + new audit
action keys with full `before_state` snapshots.

**1.5A out-of-scope:** MFA enforcement logic, reporting behavior
changes, user/invite system, UI work, the
`organizations.industry` legacy enum drop.

**Ten Category A floor tests** (five existing + five new) must
pass at exit. See brief §16 and §17 for the exit matrix and test
catalog.

## Phase 1.1 is functionally complete.

Task 18 (final verification) produced four deliverables:
- Exit criteria matrix: 42 MET / 6 DEFERRED / 3 N/A / 0 MISSED
- Schema reconciliation: clean (one non-blocking drift — stale types.ts)
- Test coverage catalog: 26 integration + 49 unit tests documented
- Phase 1.2 obligations: must-do items + 5 elevated patterns

## What Phase 1.1 ships

- Journal entries: create, list, detail, reversal (full CRUD cycle)
- Chart of Accounts: seeded per industry template
- Reports: P&L (revenue/expense/net income) + Trial Balance (per-account
  with balanced footer) via RPC functions
- RLS: cross-org isolation, role-based permissions
- 7 migrations, 26 integration tests, 49 unit tests
- Multi-tenant routing, i18n (en/fr-CA/zh-Hant), sign-in/sign-out
- Audit log with trace_id propagation

## What Phase 1.2 inherits

See docs/09_briefs/phase-1.2/obligations.md for the full list. Key items:
- Agent integration (orchestrator, tools, canvas context)
- Form UX polish (period defaults, dropdown placeholders)
- Balance Sheet report
- Regenerate types.ts, add API route tests
- Document Sync (PLAN.md audit)

## Remaining sessions

1. **Document Sync** — dedicated session for PLAN.md folder tree
   audit, stale reference grep, §18 Open Question resolution
2. **Closeout retrospective** — dedicated writing session summarizing
   patterns, calibration data, and process insights from 18 tasks

## Counts

- Migrations: 7 (001-007)
- Integration tests: 26 (7 files)
- Unit tests: 49 (4 files)
- Friction journal entries: 40+
- Subagent tasks: 5 (all zero structural drift)
- Total closeout commits: ~50 across Tasks 1-18
