## Friction Journal

Format: `[date] [category] [one-line description]`

Categories:
- WANT — wanted to do X, couldn't (missing capability)
- CLUNKY — did X, was painful (UX or DX problem)
- WRONG — the spec or the system was wrong about X
- NOTE — observation worth preserving for next phase

## Phase 2

- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — session-scope reflection has no clean
  retrospective destination per current Documentation Routing rule;
  refinement candidate for next governance amendment.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — pattern observations that are also
  deferred-codification candidates can legitimately split between
  `friction-journal.md` and `open_questions.md` per current routing
  rule; works in practice but unspecified; refinement candidate.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — brief-creation sessions (e.g.,
  S15-brief-creation, S16-brief-creation) don't always acquire
  session locks; pattern fired N=2 (`f90753b` 2026-04-26,
  `6e76d89` 2026-04-27) — N=2 is split-trigger threshold per
  Documentation Routing convention §Codification thresholds; if
  N=3 fires, codify session-lock sub-type for documentation-only
  sessions.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — Soft 8
  (`soft8EntryEightReplay.test.ts`) has post-seed snapshot UUIDs
  for ACCOUNT_CASH, ACCOUNT_UNEARNED_REVENUE,
  ORG_REAL_ESTATE_FISCAL_PERIOD_ID — fragile to
  `db:reset:clean`. Soft 9 (S19, commit `13e11f7`) uses runtime
  lookup by natural key (`org_id` + `account_code`; `org_id` +
  period name + `is_locked`) instead. Pattern for future tests:
  prefer runtime lookup over hardcoded UUIDs. Soft 8 retrofit
  candidate; codification N=2 if another test repeats hardcode.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — `accountLedgerService.test.ts` tests
  3 (line 269) and 6 (line 346) share a `find()`-without-
  trace_id-scoping pattern: each posts a JE with non-unique
  (date, amount, debit/credit) signature, then `find()`s "the
  new row"; under accumulated state from repeated `pnpm test`
  runs, `find()` returns a stale row and delta math breaks.
  Test 3 fired S18 push-readiness gate; test 6 fired S19 Task 7
  Step 4. Fix: scope `find()` by trace_id, or capture
  `entry_id` from `post()` return. N=2; next test-hygiene workstream.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE — OI-3 Part 5 M1 paid validation: PARTIAL
  per Meta A. H3b-alone on shapes 12 (1 run, productive-no-
  tentative) and 13 (2 runs, productive-tentative-on-ambiguous
  per §4a — no staling, no orphan). Shapes 15+20 untried;
  per-call halt at shape 13 run 2 ($0.163 > $0.15). Cumulative
  $0.408/$0.75 (54%). Phase 2: caching enable, 15+20 re-
  validate, CoA 4200-vs-4300 disambiguation, run-2 +30% cost
  calibration. Run record: oi3-m1-run-20260428T044651Z.json.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — S20 Task 2 Step 1 grep recipes
  used literal backticks (`` `canvas_directive` ``) which
  false-negatived against TypeScript template-literal escaped
  backticks (`` \` ``) in the source. Re-grep with distinctive-
  prose patterns (`may carry an optional`, `with a tentative`)
  resolves cleanly. Pattern for future briefs: prefer prose
  patterns over backtick-quoted code in grep recipes targeting
  template-literal source. Codification candidate at N=2 if
  another brief repeats. Brief-recipe refinement.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — S20 verification window surfaced
  that env vars exported in operator's terminal don't propagate
  to WSL session. Two paths: (i) source .env.local in-shell at
  session start (L2); (ii) tsx --env-file=.env.local at
  invocation (L3). Pattern for future paid-API or Supabase-
  touching scripts: bake --env-file=.env.local into invocation
  commands at brief-write time. Codification candidate at N=2
  if another script's brief omits the flag. Brief-recipe
  refinement.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — S20 Option iii.b stdout-write
  interception attempted at S20 Task 4 Step 1 but failed
  against the project's pino logger: pino's default destination
  (SonicBoom direct fd-1) bypasses process.stdout.write monkey-
  patching. Switched to A2: SDK-wrapper via __setClientForTests
  injecting a capturing client proxy. No src/ touches; uses
  existing test-only export. Pattern: for future paid-API
  harnesses needing usage capture, prefer SDK-wrapper over
  log-line interception. N=2 if repeated against pino.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — S20 M1 dry-run shape 12 cost
  $0.119 vs scoping doc §6 Part 5 estimate $0.015-0.020/
  invocation (~6-8× over). cache_read_tokens=0 and cache_
  creation_tokens=0 across all callClaude calls; prompt caching
  not active for orchestrator's request shape. Brief assumed 2
  callClaude calls per handleUserMessage; dry-run measured 3 on
  shape 12 — fourth-rail amplification compounds cache-disabled
  per-call cost. Phase 2: investigate Anthropic prompt-caching
  config. N=2 if a future harness repeats.
- 2026-04-27 NOTE [ROUTE?] — S20 Task 9 paid run shape 13
  emitted card+tentative on both runs (2 of 3) — productive-
  no-stale-no-orphan, but the brief's 4-state hypothesis-
  discrimination model only had emitted_card_no_tentative for
  shape 13 (per §6 Part 5's "C7-attempted productive shapes
  12, 13, 14"). Per §4a surgery, shape 13's gross-vs-net
  ambiguity legitimately warrants tentative — surgery success
  the brief's classifier didn't anticipate. Convention #8 fire
  (brief-authoring miss, not surgery or classifier-mechanic
  miss); N=3 codification trigger fires.
- 2026-04-28 NOTE — S22 caching confirmed: cache_creation 8407
  on call 1, cache_read 8407 on calls 2-3 (system+tools prefix
  stable within handleUserMessage; §4a + Site 2 preserved).
  Cost $0.119→$0.0808 per shape 12 dry-run (-32%; less than
  -58% projected — uncached messages delta 9433 tokens, 1.12×
  cached prefix). Cross-turn (Phase 2+) targets -58%. Shape
  15+20 now affordable: 9× × ~$0.08 = ~$0.72 fits scoping
  doc $0.75 ceiling. Convention #8 N=4 (quantitative-behavior
  gap). Run record: oi3-m1-cached-run-20260428T061604Z.json.
- 2026-04-28 NOTE — S23 DEV_WORKFLOW.md authoring: §2 sub-shape
  line-number citations were claimed verified but had off-by-
  one errors caught at synthesis review. Fix: dropped line-
  numbers in favor of entry-content markers (G2 / A2 /
  classifier-strictness-gap / S22 caching). Convention #8 N=5
  evidence (quantitative-behavior sub-shape in citation-
  arithmetic domain — same mechanism: claimed verified, not
  actually verified). Captured for next codification pass;
  not codified per author-judgment clause.
- 2026-04-28 NOTE — S25 non-ledger Day-1 closed at `9c0079b`:
  QW-01 MFA wiring + QW-02 read-path org checks + QW-07
  audit_log PII redaction. Six closeout items in commit body:
  (a) UF-009 doc drift (src/middleware.ts vs repo-root);
  (b) COA.get zero-callers, Edit-5 contingency moot;
  (c) UF-008→UF-002 closed by guard-not-deletion;
  (d) COA.list() error-wrap bundled per pattern-consistency;
  (e) userProfileAudit CA-15 assertion updated post-redaction;
  (f) COA.get combined-WHERE defense-in-depth vs brief's post-
  fetch (tighter; CA-23 test 3). 556/558; S26 unblocked.
- 2026-04-28 NOTE — S26 ledger-integrity Day-1 closed at
  `cbb4018`: QW-04 immutability + QW-03 date-range + QW-05
  cross-org. UF-001 immut + UF-004 + UF-005 closed (S27 closes
  atomicity). (a) Class 2 finding: test_post_balanced/unbalanced
  used current_date vs historical periods; period-range forced
  p_entry_date param. (b) journalSourceExternalId afterAll moot
  under append-only → per-run unique values. (c) DROP FUNCTION
  IF EXISTS before CREATE OR REPLACE (PostgREST overload).
  (d) crossOrgRls cascade carry-forward + entry_number UNIQUE
  decision (default defer) before S27 Task 3. 546/3/20.
- 2026-04-29 NOTE — S27 ledger atomicity Day-1 closed at
  `9334c1f`: MT-01 write_journal_entry_atomic RPC + service
  refactor + 5 rollback tests. Closes UF-001 atomicity facet
  on the post path. Paid regression: $0.07999695 cumulative on
  shape-12 single-invocation (run-record at
  $HOME/chounting-logs/oi3-m1-run-s27-20260429T015451Z.json).
  Inferential coverage: agent path→service (paid) + service→
  RPC (rollback 5/5) → composed agent confirm→RPC inferred;
  pre-existing LT-02 gap. Closeout in commit body. New surface:
  (a) entry_number UNIQUE deferred per Task 3 §0 option (a);
  unique_entry_number_per_org_period (mig 0004) is collision
  detector; FOR UPDATE bundles with Phase 2.
  (b) Supabase CLI parser bug at v1.226.4 fixed by v2.95.4.
  (c) Two-binary trap: pnpm exec resolves to node_modules
  pinned, not brew. Function-name-length bisection correlation
  reproducible byte-identically; no causal mechanism, moot
  under upgrade.
  (d) Verification-before-assertion applies to reviewers:
  `unique_entry_number_per_org_period` flagged as fabricated,
  retracted on lookup against `mig 0004:46`.
  (e) accountLedgerService running_balance value-drift third
  carry-forward; Phase 2 obligation: characterize value-drift
  vs collision-drift.
  (f) Harness `oi3-m1-validation.ts` constants permanently
  updated for S27-pattern reuse: ceilings 0.20/0.10, anchor +
  session_label. 571/3/20.
- 2026-04-29 NOTE — Post-S27 verification gate at `297256e`:
  all four gates substantively PASS; three mechanical drifts
  fixed by follow-up commit. UF-001/UF-003 lineage
  reconciliation: per `unified-findings.md`, UF-001 = ledger
  immutability (closed by S26) and UF-003 = transaction
  atomicity gap on multi-step writes (closed by S27). S27
  commit bodies (`9334c1f`, `297256e`) cite "UF-001 atomicity
  facet" — Phase-1.1 carryover framing where the original
  Phase 1.1 UF-001 covered both. **S27 substantively closes
  UF-003** per Phase 1.2's distinct numbering. Future audit
  grep for `UF-003` should treat S27's commits + this NOTE +
  the rollback test suite as the lineage. Harness Gate 4
  UF-001 expected text aligned to immutability-only
  (atomicity moved to UF-003 gate). Other drifts fixed:
  test file name (`postJournalEntryRpcRollback`), run-record
  path (`oi3-m1-run-s27-`). Sub-finding caught at re-verification:
  harness `--since=2026-04-28` (bare date) returns empty under
  git 2.43.0; replaced with ISO form
  `--since="2026-04-28T00:00:00"`. Both git-log and friction-
  journal evidence-clauses now produce findings as designed.
  Phase 2 surface expansion gate-pass: mechanical verification
  clear at this commit; unblock declaration is operator-pending.
- 2026-04-29 NOTE — Path C arc scoping at HEAD (post-d39ec09):
  arc summary committed at `docs/09_briefs/phase-1.3/path-c-arc-summary.md`
  scoping S28 (MT-05+MT-06) → S29 (MT-03 broad) → S30 (LT-01+
  LT-03+LT-04 CI-enforcement cluster) → S31 (LT-02 test
  coverage). Five-gate verification harness mirrors post-audit
  fix-stack arc shape; brief-creation sessions follow
  per-session post-ratification. Sub-finding caught at harness
  authoring: verification-harness YAML uses single-quoted
  strings; backslashes inside single-quoted YAML are literal,
  not escapes. Predecessor harness at
  `docs/09_briefs/phase-1.2/post-audit-fix-stack-arc.md` used
  `\\|` doubles which do not behave as alternations under
  `git log --grep` or `grep -E` — the YAML parser hands the
  literal string `UF-001\\|ledger` to the shell, and the regex
  engine treats `\\|` as a literal-backslash-then-pipe, not
  alternation. Path-C harness uses `\|` singles throughout
  (zero `\\|` occurrences verified via grep against the saved
  file). Post-S27 verification-gate substantive PASS despite
  the predecessor's doubles suggests either (a) verification
  agent escape-normalization, (b) manual re-running with
  corrected escaping, or (c) substring fallback matching on
  the pre-alternation portion of the pattern; either way the
  singles form is the durable shape. Same mechanical-drift-
  in-verification-harness shape as the post-S27 `--since=`
  bare-date / ISO-form sub-finding — both are "looks right
  but doesn't behave right under specific tool versions."
  Codification candidate at N=2 if a future harness reproduces
  the same drift. Optional retroactive fix to
  `post-audit-fix-stack-arc.md` (convert doubles to singles)
  deferred — closed-state doc, operator's call whether to
  fix-in-place or leave as known-drift item.
- 2026-04-29 NOTE — S29 brief-creation surfaced substrate divergence
  from arc-summary scope. Path C arc summary at `5775ae6` framed S29
  as "every org-scoped service function hand-rolls the same guard
  pattern as reads" — a one-pattern model. S29 brief-creation reads
  surfaced nine distinct patterns (A wrap target ~18 sites; B
  route-handler-wrapped ~17; C entity-id-only Pattern .in() scoping
  2; D own-profile-only 3; E entity→parent→org check 1; G1 RLS-relies-
  but-uses-adminClient security gap 4; G2 reference-data no-scoping-
  applicable 2; H user-id-scoped target-vs-caller asymmetry 1 site
  dead at bounded-read surface; I token-bearer 2). Plus Pattern J
  (auth-helpers, out of scope) and J-variant (loadOrgContext-shape,
  flagged for Phase 2). Corrigendum at `741b002` splits S29 into
  S29a (Pattern A wrap, ~18 sites; S29a brief-creation post-corrigendum)
  + S29b (Patterns C/E design + migration, 3 sites; brief-creation
  post-S30). Pattern G1 routed as separate friction-journal finding
  (severity assessment pending operator). Pattern H routed as dead-
  code finding with deferred-full-grep caveat. Comment-fix scope
  expanded to seven non-security fixes ((a)-(e), (i), (j) per the
  corrigendum's pattern-landscape appendix) + three G1-conditional.
  Codification candidate fired: read-completeness threshold (sibling
  of Convention #8 sub-shape #3); single firing with progressive
  depth — partial read surfaced 5 patterns, complete read surfaced
  9 + G1 + H. N=1; not codified. Codification target's failure mode
  named: "implementation read was partial enough to support a
  confident-shaped finding but incomplete enough that the finding
  mis-describes the substrate." Codification at N=3 per Documentation
  Routing convention if reproduced. Brief-creation session-lock not
  acquired (third firing of claim-without-substrate at brief-creation
  cwd from this session's vantage; structural-shell-mismatch hypothesis
  durable; [ROUTE?] thread updates with the morphed codification target
  "verify-after-acquire as load-bearing step in brief-creation lock
  acquisition convention"). Path C verification harness Gate 3 + Gate 4
  expected text revised; dependency graph shifted to S28 → S29a → S30 →
  S29b → S31; ship-order ~7-10 working days (was ~5-7).
